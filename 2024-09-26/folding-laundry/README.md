# Folding Laundry - From zipping, filtering and folding â€“ when your laundry gets Rusty

Presentation on 2024/09/26 by Mert Yildiz about replacing loops with chains of functional combinators.

## Presentation

The document [Chaining.pdf](<./Chaining.pdf>) contains a very rough introduction into the realm of iterators and combinators in Rust.
It is meant as a starting point for the exercises that can be found within the [src](<./src>) directory.
